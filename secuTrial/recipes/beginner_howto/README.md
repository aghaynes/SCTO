# secuTrial beginners guide

# Introduction

This manual is intended to give you a rough overview of secuTrial’s functionalities
without going into too much detail. Also, it may be helpful as an indicator when you
feel lost, which will most likely happen often during your initial user experience.
secuTrial is the software we use to set up electronic case report forms (eCRFs) for clin-
ical studies/trials. It has a browser based interface both for setup and data acquisition.

</br>
![](https://placehold.it/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) productive</span>

The colors are a good orientation and commonly the secuTrial logo in the top left
will help you assess if you are currently viewing the productive or the development
environment.

Before we get started please keep this in mind for future reference:

- If in doubt why something is not working check the account permissions in the
AdminTool.

- Never use the browser integrated navigation (←,→,F5). Only use the secuTrial
links.
