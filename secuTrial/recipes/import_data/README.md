# secuTrial data import

In most cases data will be manually entered into the eCRF. However, in some cases
batch data needs to be imported. Data imports are specified in the FormBuilder.
This recipe specifies one way to set up data import into secuTrial. Other set ups
are also possible

An importable example project is available in: <br>

2. "New import configuration"
3. configure your import according to the example below
