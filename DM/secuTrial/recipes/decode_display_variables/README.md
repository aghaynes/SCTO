# Decoding coded variables with JavaScript in secuTrial 

```diff
- Note: Starting from secuTrial version 5.5.0.10 this is no longer needed.
```

In some cases you may be asked to display values of variables in a form that have been
captured in a different form. A simple example is a Yes/No radiobutton. 
In the background "Yes" is commonly coded as a "1" and "No" as a "0".

![radiojanein](https://github.com/PatrickRWright/secuTrial-recipes/blob/master/JavaScript/decode_display_variables/fig/yes_no.png "radiojanein")

secuTrial allows you to display this value elsewhere by setting the rule "Display value from ..."
within a "Layout-Dummy" item. The placeholder (e.g. $50$) variable gives you access to the value. 

![dispfrom](https://github.com/PatrickRWright/secuTrial-recipes/blob/master/JavaScript/decode_display_variables/fig/display_from.png "dispfrom")

Within HTML active fields of the "Layout-Dummy" the placeholder can be entered.
However, secuTrial will only display the coded form. This can be problematic especially when more than two options are encoded.

![spender0](https://github.com/PatrickRWright/secuTrial-recipes/blob/master/JavaScript/decode_display_variables/fig/spender0.png "spender0")

JavaScript can remedy such problems. Please note that the placeholder variable is used within the JavaScript code.

```javascript
<script>
if ($50$ == 1) { 
    document.write("aktiv"); 
} else { 
    document.write("inaktiv"); 
} 
</script>
```

Such scripts can be used within all HTML active fields in the FormBuilder.

![jslab](https://github.com/PatrickRWright/secuTrial-recipes/blob/master/JavaScript/decode_display_variables/fig/javascript_label.png "jslab")

Now the display shows the decoded value.
