# secuTrial catalog upload 

Certain input data may already be available in a standardized form. In these cases a secuTrail catalog can be created to aid  in standardization of data entry. Examples where such catalogs are used are adresses or medicines. A small example catalog of medical products can be found [here](https://github.com/PatrickRWright/SCTO/blob/master/DM/secuTrial/data/med_catalog.csv).
